# LoanSystem

 A Windows Forms Loan Management System created with C# (JSON is used as a form of storage)


 Quick Note: There is a meme image (`among_us_twerk.gif`) that was originally a joke between me and my friend (I sent a video of my finished work with that image in the about tab/form). Deleting the file causes a crash, i dont really know how to fix it nor the time to figure it out how to fix it right now since i am currently learning more about php, github, and css. I would probably fix that in the future. This project is made for the purpose of testing out my backend ability since this is the first app i created where my backend skills are applied with a gui in it since my previous works was only made in the console app which is a hassle to do since there was a lot of console.WriteLine(); and strings everywhere. *Image not owned by me. Included for meme purposes only. Credits to the real owner(I really did tried finding the original owner but the internet is just full of twerking among us memes with meme context in it without the original creator so my bad).*
